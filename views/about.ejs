      <h1>About Our Movie Search Project</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to our movie search application! This project was created to
        provide a simple yet powerful way to discover movies using the vast
        database of The Movie Database (TMDB).
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to offer a seamless user experience, allowing you to quickly
        find movie posters, descriptions, and release dates. We believe in clean
        design and efficient functionality to make your movie exploration
        enjoyable.
      </p>
      <p>
        This application is built with Node.js and Express on the backend for
        handling API requests and serving dynamic content, and EJS for rendering
        the views. We've focused on creating a responsive design that works well
        across various devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for using our application. We hope you find it useful for all
        your movie searching needs!
